                   <p>Master Curators<br />
                    Do you believe in more show than tell?<br />
                    Relevents is looking for highly curious super-connectors who are cross-trained in curation and
                    execution, have a mind for and understand marketing and can cross-pollinate with business
                    development. This role not only requires aggregation but original experience creation across
                    communities. You will build business athletic programs, expedition learning, festivals and custom
                    curations. You will be the master of professional development learning and networking
                    experiences. You must have a desire and an ability to disrupt the event space and take risks.
                    You will manage a budget and be creative in getting there, which requires expert negotiation
                    skills. You will collaborate across teams, challenge what’s out there and design and deliver
                    contextual experiences that transform people’s lives. If you are a highly networked, intrinsically
                    curious person who can create commercial businesses in the form of event experiences – love
                    what you do but want to take it to the nth level – let’s talk.</p>

                <p>Business Development Leaders<br />
                    If you are a highly networked relationship person who can sell a vision, manage targets, are a
                    team player and get excited about what’s next – then let’s see if you’re a fit.  We think you’ll like
                    it here. Change is good.</p>

                <p>Marketing Leader<br />
                    Are you a B2B marketing genius who understands traditional and non-traditional forms of
                    marketing? Are you experienced in engagement and conversion in cross-platform marketing
                    campaigns? Are you fluent across touch points? Do you believe it’s time to reset KPIS? If you still
                    believe the term “main mail desktop” is relevant, this is not for you. However, if you are ready to
                    get the right offerings into the right budgets by capturing market share and attracting the next
                    generation of leadership, then let’s chat.</p>

            	<p>Digital Engagement Director<br />
                    If you understand and promote social by design and know how to integrate content, create
                    content and deliver content seamlessly across touch points, keep reading. Do you have
                    experience in the B2B space and are expert at understanding the different social media
                    channels? Can you build communities, measure conversion and drive growth through multiple
                    media touch points by holistically building the social presence commercially and authentically
                    into the campaign, tying it back to the events and achieving measurable revenue? Then let’s talk.</p>

            	<p>Head of Operations and Logistics<br />
                    If you can bring a vision to life in creative and efficient ways, have experience running festivals 
                    and high impact trainings, alternative venue selection, outsourcing vendor selection and have
                    expert negotiation skills, please consider us. You would be an incredibly integral part of the team.
                    Relevents needs a strong logistics person to execute experience design and participate in the
                    collaboration process. This is far from a meeting planner; this is a person who is ready to shake
                    things up in event delivery.

                    thinkers and are organized and efficient and can liaise with senior level people inside and outside
                    the organization, then think of us. We are looking for future leaders that can support different
